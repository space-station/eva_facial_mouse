## Requirements

* Mobile phone or tablet
* Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) or higher

See the [list of devices tested with EVA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gxuIKbw92d9USPT_SvM0iCdWjtnVcx7owJAgwM6Za6w/).

## Limitations

Due to pre-existing restrictions of the Android platform, there are currently some limitations.

* It cannot be used simultaneously with other applications that make use of the camera.
* For Android versions prior to 5.1 most standard keyboards do not work with EVA, so a basic keyboard is provided. Such a keyboard needs to be manually activated after the installation.
* Does not work with most games. 
* Browsers do not handle properly some actions (we recommend using Google Chrome).
* Applications such as Maps, Earth and Gallery work with restrictions.

For obvious reasons, EVA has not been tested with all devices available on the market. If you find any issues with your device, please, let us know.
